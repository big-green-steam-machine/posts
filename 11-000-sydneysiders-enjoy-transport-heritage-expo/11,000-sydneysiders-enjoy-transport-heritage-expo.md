**Thousands of Sydneysiders descended on Central Station during the October long weekend for this year's *Transport Heritage Expo* â€” the first in over three years.**

Just under 11,000 people purchased tickets (an all new Expo record), with many thousands more coming along to join in on the fun and festivities.

Transport Heritage NSW couldn't be more proud of our transport heritage community, who came together to showcase our State's transport history.

A big congratulations to our volunteers and staff, as well as those from the following partner organisations:

* Australian National Maritime Museum (operators of *Ena* steam yacht)
* Powerhouse (owners of Locomotive 3265)
* Rail Motor Society Paterson (railmotor operators)
* Sydney Bus Museum (operators of vintage bus rides)
* Sydney Tramway Museum (heritage displays exhibitor)
* Sydney Electric Train Society Inc (heritage displays exhibitor)
* Sydney Heritage Fleet (operators of *Waratah* steam tug)
* The Fresh Collective (operators of Devonshire Tea sittings)
* Historic Electric Traction (operators of vintage electric train rides)

The event would not have been possible without the support and assistance of Transport for NSW and Sydney Trains, as well as our event sponsor rt health.
