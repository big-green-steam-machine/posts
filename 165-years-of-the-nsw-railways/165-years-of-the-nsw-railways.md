**Today marks 165 years since the opening of the first railway line in New South Wales, between Sydney and Parramatta.**

People gathered in their thousands along the 22km stretch of line to catch a glimpse of the first train, which left Sydney at 11.20am to a 21 gun salute.

The first day of operations included six return passenger services with 3,554 tickets issued in total.

Rare examples from those early years of the NSW railways survive today and are on public display, including Locomotive No. 1 at the [Powerhouse Museum](https://www.facebook.com/powerhousemuseum/?__cft__[0]=AZVorNIICzdZeqfXX7jo1SrdLHoImPMcYgKZUdaUQKsjY8ah7Doc9cVgy8NopQnBWnTGNSmVEg77fO2DZTl4bGyuxdY63KC8-fw5LTJJJM65McNSglAm2FZ5VidHm9msdaa3uLxxykWvSLRoWh9aNo2dm6LVImtOoAjSM1Gvc_AjDeM06oSUDvGQiQ_PgFYMU_aeaT4dmkEqw4PcZJ0OpFJ9&__tn__=kK-R) and Locomotive No. 78 at the [NSW Rail Museum](https://www.facebook.com/NSWRailMuseum/?__cft__[0]=AZVorNIICzdZeqfXX7jo1SrdLHoImPMcYgKZUdaUQKsjY8ah7Doc9cVgy8NopQnBWnTGNSmVEg77fO2DZTl4bGyuxdY63KC8-fw5LTJJJM65McNSglAm2FZ5VidHm9msdaa3uLxxykWvSLRoWh9aNo2dm6LVImtOoAjSM1Gvc_AjDeM06oSUDvGQiQ_PgFYMU_aeaT4dmkEqw4PcZJ0OpFJ9&__tn__=kK-R).
