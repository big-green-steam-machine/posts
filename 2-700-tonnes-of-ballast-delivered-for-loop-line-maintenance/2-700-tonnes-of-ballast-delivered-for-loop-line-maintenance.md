**This week, 2,700 tonnes of ballast was delivered and placed on the section of the line between Thirlmere and Buxton as part of regular maintenance to the Loop Line.**

Transport Heritage NSW worked with Southern Shorthaul Railroad (SSR) and track and civil company Earth Track Solutions to deliver the ballast from Bombo Quarry to Thirlmere. The delivery is the largest ever to occur on the Loop Line, and the only one by rail in more than 40 years.

Originally designated for the section of track between Thirlmere and Couridjah, THNSW were fortunate to comfortably stretch the stock nearly all the way to Buxton.

The next stage of maintenance will see tamping and resurfacing machines used over the section later in the year.
