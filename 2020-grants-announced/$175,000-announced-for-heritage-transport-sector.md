**THNSW CEO, Andrew Moritz, today announced $175,000 in grants for the heritage transport sector during a special online presentation.**

The Transport Heritage Grants Program is a NSW Government funded program, administered by the Royal Australian Historical Society (RAHS) and supported by THNSW. It aims to help the NSW community rediscover the culture, events and people that shaped transport over the past 165 years, as well as assist with the restoration and conservation of NSW’s valuable heritage assets.

This year’s grants bring to life heritage transport projects ranging from historic bus, ferry and locomotive restorations to the production of exhibitions and publications.
