**Submissions for the 2020 Transport Heritage Grants Program are now OPEN!**

**The Transport Heritage Grants Program is run on an annual basis to support organisations in preserving, exploring and promoting the history of land-based heritage transport in NSW.**

Projects in the following categories are eligible for funding:

* Restoration, reconstruction or preservation of a heritage transport item;
* Education, publication or interpretation of an event, item/s or person/s that will promote heritage transport;
* Study, consultation, report or review that will assist in managing a heritage transport place or item.

Applicants can apply for up to three grants in any year. While grants of up to $15,000 are generally available, one large grant may be awarded each year up to an amount of $50,000 should the Independent Funding and Advisory Panel believe there is a particularly meritorious application.

The closing date for the 2020 Transport Heritage Grants Program is **Wednesday 12 August 2020.**

For more information, including guidelines and an application, visit the [Royal Australian Historical Society website](https://bit.ly/2YG2oAu).

*The Transport Heritage Grants Program is funded by the NSW Government and administered by the Royal Australian Historical Society with the support of Transport Heritage NSW.*
