**2020 has been a year like no other. From droughts and bushfires, to floods, and then the coronavirus pandemic.**

Despite the challenges, Transport Heritage NSW volunteers and staff came together to achieve some great results throughout what has been a truly ‘unprecedented’ year.

We now look forward to bringing you new and exciting heritage transport initiatives and experiences in 2021.

From all of the team, Happy New Year!
