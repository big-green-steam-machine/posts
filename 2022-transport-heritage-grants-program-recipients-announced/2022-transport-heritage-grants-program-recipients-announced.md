**Ten transport heritage sector organisations across NSW have been announced as recipients of this year’s Transport Heritage Grants Program.**

Transport Heritage NSW Chair, The Hon. Nathan Rees, and NSW Minister for Transport, David Elliott MP, presented the grants at a special ceremony at the Australian National Maritime Museum – the first in-person ceremony in three years.

Nine grants were announced for restoration and conservation projects of transport heritage assets, including seat recovering for heritage trams, a water tank rebuild for an historic steam locomotive and preservation of transport uniforms.

One grant, awarded in the ‘education and publication’ category, was for a new book by the Albury and District Historical Society on connecting the NSW and Victorian railway systems.

This year’s major grant recipient was to the Rail Motor Society, based in Paterson NSW, for the refurbishment and restoration to service of rail motor unit 602/707.

Rail Motor Society Secretary, Mick Walsh says they’re honoured and pleased to have been awarded this grant.

> “It’s a large project we are now able to undertake, and the grant will support its first stage. The whole project will bring the rail motors in main line operating condition and meet the relevant standards for main line operations.”
