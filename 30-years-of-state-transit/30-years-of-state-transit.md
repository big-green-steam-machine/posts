**This year marks the 30th anniversary since the formation of the State Transit Authority (STA) of NSW.**

On Sunday 17 March, during one of their regular open days, the Sydney Bus Museum ran an additional service using former STA vintage buses and showcased an enhanced display of STA era buses at the museum.

On top of the regular half hourly vintage double-decker service to the Queen Victoria Building, volunteers ran single-deck, former STA buses to Huntleys Point. A variety of Mercedes and MAN buses from the 80s and 90s were also displayed at the event.

Thank you to all the visitors who joined us for this special open day.
