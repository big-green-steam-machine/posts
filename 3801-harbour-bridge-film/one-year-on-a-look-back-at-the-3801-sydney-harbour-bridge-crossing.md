**One year ago today, Transport Heritage NSW made history by crossing the Sydney Harbour Bridge for the first time with iconic steam locomotive 3801.**

**On the first anniversary of this monumental event, we are pleased to make the journey available for all to enjoy and experience through real-time coverage of the crossing. This amazing short film follows 3801 along its journey from Central Station, through the Sydney Underground for the first time, and across this iconic structure.**

The short film is available to watch above.

Locomotive 3801 will be at Central Station for cab visits for Transport Heritage Expo this weekend - for more information, visit [transportheritageexpo.com/](http://transportheritageexpo.com/)

We are grateful for the assistance our friends and colleagues at Sydney Trains and Transport for NSW for their support with making this historic event possible.
