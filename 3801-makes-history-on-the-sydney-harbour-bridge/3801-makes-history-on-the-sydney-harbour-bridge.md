**Today, history was made as Legend of Steam Locomotive 3801 travelled across the Sydney Harbour Bridge for the very first time.**

After travelling through the city underground and onto the main deck of the Bridge, the locomotive paused briefly to salute the iconic structure, which turned 90 earlier this year.

Around 120 passengers were aboard the train, including THNSW members and volunteers, as well as special ticket holders from the Sydney Harbour Bridge's 90th Anniversary back in March.

Transport Heritage NSW would like to thank Transport for NSW and Sydney Trains for their support with this significant operation.
