**Transport Heritage NSW (THNSW) has transferred Locomotive 3820 to the Chullora Workshops to begin its static restoration.**

**The locomotive was hauled from the NSW Rail Museum in Thirlmere, located in Sydney’s southwest, and delivered to Chullora, where it was shunted into the workshops. THNSW volunteers will now commence work to restore the locomotive for public display at the NSW Rail Museum, following the professional removal of hazardous materials, including asbestos.**

The restoration project will involve cleaning components, treating corrosion, repairing timber in the driver’s cab after detailed inspections, reconstructing key elements, and repainting the locomotive in its authentic 'out of service' livery.

Built in 1947 at the NSW Government Railways’ Eveleigh Workshops in Sydney, Locomotive 3820 was designed for premier express passenger services. It is most famously associated with the Sydney–Newcastle Express, better known as the *Newcastle Flyer*, and is a prime example of the pinnacle of Australian steam locomotive engineering.

Locomotive 3820 holds special significance as the only member of its class to remain in original condition as it operated in active service. Once restoration is complete, it will return to the NSW Rail Museum for public display.

**About 3820**

Built in 1947 by the NSW Government Railways’ Eveleigh Workshops, 3820 was the 20th of 30 38-class locomotives designed for express trains. While the first five were streamlined, the subsequent 25, including 3820, were not streamlined and were built at the Eveleigh and Cardiff Workshops.

3820 has a notable history in steam operations:

* May 1964: Hauled the last steam-operated Riverina Express and the final revenue steam duty on the Main South line beyond Goulburn.
* December 1968: Was the last C38 class to be overhauled while in service.
* December 1970: Worked the final steam-hauled express passenger train in Australia, the Newcastle Flyer, and was the last 38-class in revenue service.

After its withdrawal, 3820 was preserved by the NSW Rail Transport Museum (now Transport Heritage NSW), initially at Enfield and later relocated to Thirlmere in 1975. In 1980, it was displayed at Central Station for the 125th anniversary of NSW rail operations.

3820 is the only 38-class locomotive preserved in its original condition and remains part of the NSW Government-owned state collection managed by Transport Heritage NSW.

*Further updates will be provided as the project commences.*
