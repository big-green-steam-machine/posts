**On June 8-12, Transport Heritage NSW returned to the Central West for the Bathurst Steam Weekend.**

**Around 4,000 people travelled with us throughout the event, including approximately 350 enthusiastic school children eager to learn about our rail heritage. We travelled an impressive distance of 1,246km with two historic steam locomotives 3526 and 3642.**

A dedicated team of 40 passionate staff and volunteers supported the operation, showcasing the power of teamwork and camaraderie in delivering an exceptional experience for our customers.

Notably, this trip marked the first regional visit for 3526 since its reactivation in 2004, demonstrating our commitment to connecting the community with our state's transport heritage collection.

None of these accomplishments would have been possible without our invaluable partnerships and collaboration with Transport Asset Holding Entity of NSW (TAHE) , Transport for NSW, NSW TrainLink, UGL Regional Linx, and Bathurst Rail Museum.
