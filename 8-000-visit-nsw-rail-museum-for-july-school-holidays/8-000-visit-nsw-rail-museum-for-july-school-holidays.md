**Over 8,000 people visited the NSW Rail Museum during the recent July School Holidays â€” a remarkable 25% increase compared to the previous record holiday period in April.**

The record result is thanks to our fleet and rail ops teams increasing capability to offer more regular heritage train services on the Loop Line, marking the first time steam has run for the entire duration of the school holidays.

Locomotive 3265 took over the regular loop line duties from Wednesday 5 July 2023, marking its return to steam for the first time in seven months.

A big thank you to all volunteers and teams who helped deliver an exceptional result during what was a very busy two weeks.
