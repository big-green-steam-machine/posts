**This year marks five years since the establishment of Transport Heritage NSW.**

**During this time, we’ve achieved some amazing milestones, including record breaking visitation to our museums and events, impressive restorations of our heritage fleet and providing funding and support to the heritage transport sector.**

Looking ahead, with new commitments by the NSW Government including investment in the loop line and establishment of the Chullora Heritage Hub, we have a great opportunity to set a new direction for the future.

That’s why today Transport Heritage NSW has released a draft strategic plan to guide the organisation to 2024.

As a Transport Heritage NSW member, we’re keen to hear your feedback by Friday 10 May before the plan is finalised.
