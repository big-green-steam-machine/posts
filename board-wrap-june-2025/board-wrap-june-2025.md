**2025 National Trust Heritage Award Wins**

**The Board expressed *congratulations to everyone on our incredible award wins!**

THNSW was recognised in four categories:

- ***Winner****– Events Category* – Transport Heritage Expo 2024

- ***Winner****– People’s Choice Award* – Transport Heritage Expo 2024

- ***Winner****– Individual Heritage Skills Award* – Ben Elliot, Fleet Maintenance Manager

The dedication to what we do as an organisation has truly paid off, and these achievements are a testament to the passion and teamwork that define us.

I attended the Awards presentation and it's thrilling to see our hard work recognized and celebrated alongside some truly outstanding individuals, community groups and organisations who share our passion for bringing heritage to life for the community.

**Board Appointments**

The Board confirmed the appointment of its key roles for another year:

Deputy Chair – Alex Claassens

Our Board Advisory Subcommittees will be lead by:

Safety & Environment – Alex Claassens

Finance, Risk & Audit – Deanna Varga

Collections & Curatorial – Dale Budd OBE

Organisational Culture – myself

The recruitment of a new Volunteer Company Secretary is well underway, and I expect to announce that appointment in the very near future, once confirmed by the Board.

**Our Heritage Asset Custody and Funding Arrangements with the NSW Government**

I am pleased to confirm that our cornerstone agreements with the NSW Government have been successfully extended for another year to 30 June 2026.

This extension marks a continued commitment to collaborating and achieving long-term goals and better outcomes for the transport heritage assets charged to our care for the people of NSW.

Over the next twelve months we will be working with Transport for NSW (TfNSW) and the Transport Asset Manager (TAM) to renew and refresh the arrangements.

**Valley Heights Site**

The Board was updated on the work being done at site to address immediate concerns to improve the visitor experience and working conditions for our people. The thorough briefing provided transparency around the nature of the actions already and being taken in response. Stage 1 of the works will be completed in time for the flagship annual event at the site - the Blue Mountains Steam FunFest - in July during the school holidays.

Ensuring the wellbeing of our team members remains the top priority, and the Board has expressed its strong support for the work done by the local VH team in response, plus the ongoing improvements needed moving forward.

**New Strategic Plan**

The Board considered the first draft of our new strategic plan and will hold a workshop later this month to bring the draft strategic plan to the point ready for consultation with our workforce, members and key stakeholders. The new plan will shape our future with purpose and ambition and bring strong alignment on our key priorities for the next five years. More information will soon follow on how you will be able to provide input to help refine the final strategy.

Let’s take a moment to enjoy the many milestones we have achieved over the last year – then keep the momentum going for whatever challenges and triumphs lie ahead!

**The Hon Nathan Rees**

Chair
