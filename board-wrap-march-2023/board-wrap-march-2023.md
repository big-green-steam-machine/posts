**The Board held its second Board meeting for 2023 on Tuesday 28 March 2023.**

**New NSW Government**

The Board noted the NSW State Election result on Saturday 25 March.

I want to thank and acknowledge the outgoing Minister for Transport, The Hon. David Elliott for his support of THNSW. I also want to thank the outgoing Member for Wollondilly, Nathaniel Smith for his passion and commitment for the NSW Rail Museum and Loop Line upgrade project.

I now look forward to working with the incoming NSW Government, including newly appointed Minister for Transport, The Hon. Jo Haylen. It’s my priority to ensure we continue to work closely with government to continue to strengthen and grow the good work THNSW does in the community, and I have already written to the Minister. We have also invited Jo to visit the NSW Rail Museum and/or join us on one of our upcoming main line heritage train experiences.

**Thirlmere Festival of Steam 2023**

Our second Thirlmere Festival of Steam delivered in partnership with the Wollondilly Shire Council was held over the weekend of 18 & 19 March.

This year we operated more seats on our Loop Line rides to support this great community event. Saturday saw our highest Thirlmere Festival of Steam Saturday attendance ever, whilst Sunday’s record-breaking heat kept the crowds down from last year’s record Sunday result.

Over the two days we saw almost 8,200 visitors to the NSW Rail Museum, with over 6,100 passengers enjoying a Loop Line steam train ride.

Thank you to everyone involved in delivering this great event!

**Major projects updates**

The Board received an update from the CEO on our two major projects.

**Heritage Hub** – works to refurbish and upgrade the Tank Annex are continuing with the building on track for handover in April ready for track installation. Sydney Trains will be installing the track, which has been slightly delayed and now expected to be completed by the first week of May.

The planning to move almost 50 items of rolling stock, associated parts and spares, as well as a range of other small object collection items to be housed in the Tank Annex is well progressed.

More on this will be communicated in the coming couple of months, particularly how volunteers and staff can help make this move happen.

**Loop Line Upgrade Project** – for the latest update simply go to our webpage [Loop Line Upgrade Project](https://www.thnsw.com.au/loop-line#:~:text=PROJECT%20SCHEDULE,between%20Picton%20and%20Buxton%20completed.&text=By%20mid%2D2023%3A%20review%20of,between%20Buxton%20and%20Colo%20Vale.&text=Mid%2D2023%3A%20works%20commence%20to,between%20Buxton%20and%20Colo%20Vale.).

**Next Board meeting**

The next Board meeting is scheduled to take place on Tuesday 30 May 2023, with a Board, CEO and management team workshop to take place ahead of this date.

In closing, I again want to thank and congratulate everyone involved what has been a great March.

Keep up the great work!

**The Hon. Nathan Rees**
Chair
