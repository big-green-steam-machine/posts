**Welcome to the Board Wrap for October providing our THNSW Members with a quick summary of key discussions and decisions by the THNSW Board at its latest meeting.**

**Western Sydney Tourism Awards 2024**

The Board extends its heartfelt congratulations to the THNSW team for securing two prestigious Platinum Awards at the inaugural Western Sydney Tourism Awards:

🏆 **Best Historical Venue – Visitation:**  NSW Rail Museum
🏆 **Best Visitor Economy Event Day Visitation:**  Thirlmere Festival of Steam, delivered in partnership with Wollondilly Shire Council

These awards underscore the record-breaking visitor numbers at the NSW Rail Museum, highlighting its growing appeal as a premier attraction within Greater Sydney.

Extra thanks to our customer delivery teams who are out in front when it comes to our events and customer-facing activities: Engagement, Rail Operations, and Operational Fleet Maintenance.

The Board’s congratulations also go to our Wollondilly Shire Council partners for the Thirlmere Festival of Steam.

**Transport Heritage Expo 2024**

The Board again extended its congratulations to the THNSW Team on this year’s *Transport Heritage Expo 2024*, held at Central Station over the October long weekend.  This year was our largest ever, surpassing all previous annual records, with more than 12,400 ticketed customers.

The Board’s congratulations also go to our sector partners, without whom this celebration of our rich transport heritage in NSW would not be possible:  Sydney Bus Museum, Sydney Tramway Museum, Sydney Heritage Fleet, Historic Electric Traction, The Rail Motor Society, East Coast Heritage Rail, and Pacific National.

**Rolling Stock Collection Projects**

The Board approved funding from our General Restoration Fund for works to two rolling stock items from THNSW’s own Collection:

**CPH 13** – for major overhaul works to return CPH 13 to service giving us additional railmotor capacity and operational flexibility for when the Loop Line Upgrade Project is completed and we begin extended operations.

**‘Bronzewing’** – for the volunteer-led restoration of this ‘saddle tank’ steam locomotive to arrest its current deterioration and bring it back to better display condition at the NSW Rail Museum.

**Annual General Meeting 2024**

The Notice of AGM 2024 went out to all Ordinary Members eligible to vote on 18 October 2024.  Balloting in the election of an Elected Director and online voting on the other business item for the meeting is open and will close at 5:00pm on Sunday 24 November 2024.  Questions on notice close at 5:00pm on Friday 8 November 2024.

The formal proceedings of the AGM will be followed by an informal Members’ Information Forum to give members the opportunity to hear the update on our latest achievements and upcoming activities, and conclude with the opportunity to mingle and catch up with each other.

Members of the Board look forward to seeing those Members attending on Tuesday 26 November 2024.

The Board recognised the higher than ever before levels of activity in every area of the organisation and the extra efforts by everyone across the entire workforce team.

Until my next update on the Board, take care.

**The Hon. Nathan Rees**

Chair
