**The Board held its final meeting on Saturday 8 December for calendar year 2018. This was also the first meeting of the new Board for our new membership year 2018-19 since the AGM, which was held on 24 November 2018.**

There were several highlights from this meeting.

Board positions:

* Alex Claassens will be Deputy Chair
* Brett Fitzpatrick will continue as Company Secretary
* Howard Collins, Nev Nichols and Leann Meiers will continue as Board Subcommittee Chairs for the Finance, Audit & Risk Committee (FA&RC); Safety & Environment Committee (SEC); and Fundraising Strategy Development Working Group (FSDWG), respectively

The Board acknowledged the adoption of the new constitution by the membership at the AGM 2018, the leadership of Brett Fitzpatrick and the professional and enthusiastic efforts of the working group members to achieve this.

The Board will be reviewing and publishing the criteria for nominations to serve as THNSW Board Directors ahead of next year's elected director elections so that these can be published on the THNSW website in the first quarter of 2019. Bearing in mind the clauses in the newly adopted constitution relating to director elections, the Board and management team will work in the New Year to provide clear communications to members regarding the new arrangements.

The Board congratulated everyone involved in the successful unveiling of the Central Station WWI honour boards, as well as the relaunch of steam locomotive 3265. The Board will be looking to celebrate and promote our THNSW and NSW Rail Museum achievements more in the future.

Standing agenda items discussed by the Board included:

* Safety and environment
* Locomotive 3801 project
* Other operational fleet opportunities, including a recommendation from the Curatorial Committee
* Our financial performance and funding
* Approval of new THNSW members

Going forward, we will include progress reporting on our newly announced 'Chullora Heritage Hub' project.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the Board, CEO, staff and volunteers for what has been a very successful year in 2018. I look forward to working and volunteering with you all again in 2019.

Best wishes for the festive season and wishing you all a happy New Year and safe holiday season.

**Rob Mason**
**Chair**
