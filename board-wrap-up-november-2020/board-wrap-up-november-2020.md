**The THNSW AGM was held on Saturday 28 November 2020 for the first time by webinar. 57 members attended the AGM and 145 members lodged valid proxies before the meeting.**

Members adopted the minutes of the 2019 AGM and received the 2019-20 Annual Report. It was certainly a year like no other and the 2020 highlights video shown at the AGM (and now available to view [here](https://youtu.be/3mS7agRuSKw)), demonstrated just how much we achieved despite all the challenges we faced throughout the year. Let’s hope 2021 is a better year.

During the AGM, we also congratulated our five new life members: Stephen Corrigan, Ian Gregory, Glenn Hargrave, John Lloyd, and David Sinfield. These individuals have made exemplary contributions to the organisation over a long period of time. Life membership is the highest honour we can bestow on a THNSW member.

On behalf of members, I congratulate Alex Claassens on being re-elected and Andrea Plawutsky on being re-appointed to the THNSW Board. Both Alex and Andrea are appointed for three-year terms until the 2023 AGM. I look forward to working with them both and their respective contributions on the THNSW Board in the years ahead.

Two important items of business were passed by the AGM as follows:

* *Deaccessioning five member-owned assets*
  The deaccessioning of five member-owned items of rolling stock that had been determined by our Collections & Curatorial Committee as being both beyond restoration and no longer required as other better examples are also in the collection. Whilst regrettable, this does allow us to focus our efforts on caring for other items in the collection.
* *Updated THNSW Constitution*
  81.9% of members voted in favour of updating the THNSW Constitution, more than the 75% required for a special resolution. The new constitution can be found under the Governance section of the '[what we do](https://www.thnsw.com.au/what-we-do)' page on the THNSW website.

Members who were unable to join us for the AGM can read the draft minutes and answers to the Questions on Notice received from members at the Annual General Meetings page.

**Members’ information forum**

The AGM was followed by a Members Information Forum, where Board Director Deanna Varga updated members on the membership product review and results of the membership and audience survey. More work will be undertaken in the new year.

CEO, Andrew Moritz update members on various initiatives currently underway across the organisation including the Heritage Hub and Loop Line projects. We anticipate significant progress being made on these two important projects in 2021.

The NSW Rail Museum will re-open seven days per week from Saturday 2 January 2021, with train rides on the Loop Line every day throughout the January school holidays.

As we draw closer to the end of what has been a truly unprecedented year, I look forward to 2021 where we will see lots of activity to re-engage our customers and undertaking those important projects behind the scenes, which not only support our responsibilities to care for the collection, but enhance our customers’ experience. This includes works to our passenger carriages to improve the onboard experience we offer.

I wish you all a safe and happy, and COVID safe, Christmas and New Year and I look forward to seeing you in 2021.
