**Thousands of people flocked to stations and railway lines to catch a glimpse of 3801 as it travelled some 2,250km through the Central West of NSW in June.**

The tour visited the towns of Bathurst, Blayney, Orange, Parkes and Dubbo, carrying over 7,000 people in just 10-days.

Transport Heritage NSW would like to thank all of its volunteers and staff on a very successful operation, as well as our colleagues at Sydney Trains, NSW TrainLink, Bathurst Rail Museum and Blayney Shire Council for their support.
