**Work continues on stage one of the Chullora Heritage Hub, which is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.**

**Trackwork to the Tank Annex is scheduled to commence the week of 24 April and continue through the beginning of May. This will see six lines of track installed into the building. Work is on schedule to enable the transfer of heritage items from various locations in the coming months.**

Heritage Hub will provide secure undercover storage and a centralised location for a significant part of Transport Heritage NSWâ€™s collection of rolling stock.
