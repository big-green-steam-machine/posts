**The Cooma Monaro Railway Museum was officially opened earlier this month.**

The Museum is the culmination of over five years work by volunteers of the Cooma Monaro Railway. It is housed inside the beautifully restored Cooma Railway Station building, which forms part of the Transport Heritage NSW portfolio.

As the gateway to the Snowy Mountains area, Cooma was a key destination by train for almost 100 years. During its service, the line was used to convey numerous tourists to the ski fields in the winter and many recreational fishermen and women for trout fishing in the warmer months. It was also instrumental in the building of the Snowy Mountains Scheme.
