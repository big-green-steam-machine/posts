**Transport Heritage NSW continues to work within the guidelines and advice provided by the State and Federal governments in managing risks associated with the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.**

The health and safety of our customers, volunteers and staff is our top priority which is why weâ€™re responding with a variety of precautionary measures across all our museums and operations.

**For now, the NSW Rail Museum will continue to remain open with additional measures taken to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.**
 
These additional measures include:

* The temporary suspension of all passenger heritage train operations, including *Steam Train Weekends* at the NSW Rail Museum.
* The temporary suspension of all dedicated public programming at the NSW Rail Museum, including large events, onsite learning programs, guided tours, along with all school holiday and vacation care activities.
* An enhanced cleaning regime. This includes bathroom facilities being regularly checked to ensure they are clean and sanitised, and well stocked. Hand sanitiser will also be made available.

The NSW Rail Museum is a large, open-air site where visitors can easily follow social distancing guidelines.

Separately, in consultation with our volunteers, we have taken the decision to close the Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum to the public until further notice.

**Customer refunds**
Customers who have purchased tickets for any of our upcoming events, including *Steam Train Weekends, Blue Mountains Flyer* or *Day Out With Thomas*, will be automatically refunded in full over the next 3-7 business days.

Please direct any ticketing or group booking inquiries to our customer service team on 1300 11 55 99 or [customers@thnsw.com.au](mailto:customers@thnsw.com.au)

**Keeping you informed as advice changes**
We will continue to monitor the situation and take guidance from the relevant authorities and will respond promptly to any new information or advice. 
 
We encourage you to keep updated by following our social media channels and regularly checking the THNSW news page: [www.thnsw.com.au/news](http://www.thnsw.com.au/news)

*Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.*
