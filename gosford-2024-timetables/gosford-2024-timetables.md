**Transport Heritage NSW is set to operate a weekend of steam train rides from Gosford Station across 6 and 7 July 2024.**

The weekend will see Beyer-Garratt 6029 taking passengers on 60-minute heritage train experiences from Gosford Station towards Hawkesbury River and return on Saturday 6 and Sunday 7 July. Prior to the event, Beyer-Garratt 6029 will transfer to Hawkesbury River, where it will stable ahead of the weekend.

Below are the confirmed times for this weekend’s operations, as well as the transfer times from Thirlmere to Hawkesbury River. Transfer times are indicative only – the train may run earlier or later depending on the wider rail network.

Those who intend to catch a glimpse of the train, please remember to stand behind the yellow line at stations, and remain only in publicly accessible areas, clear of the rail corridor.

Please note, Beyer-Garratt 6029 is not publicly accessible or visible while stabled at Hawkesbury River. Do not enter the rail corridor to view the locomotive.
