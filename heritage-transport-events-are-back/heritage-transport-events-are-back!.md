**Following an extended period of lockdowns and restrictions, THNSW was able to conduct one of its first community events for 2022 last weekend.**

Events like these are only made possible thanks to the generous support of Transport for NSW and passionate volunteers, such as those from the Sydney Tramway Museum and Sydney Bus Museum.

Why not jump onboard and join us as a volunteer, or experience one of our upcoming events?
