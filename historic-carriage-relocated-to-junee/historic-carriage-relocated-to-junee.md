**Lavatory carriage LFX 1776 has been relocated for display to the Junee Roundhouse Railway Museum.**

Prior to the introduction of lavatory cars, passengers on long distance journeys had to wait until the train made scheduled stops at stations to use the facilities. The introduction of lavatory cars allowed people to use the toilet on the go.

LFX 1776 forms part of the NSW Government’s State-Owned Heritage Collection, managed by Transport Heritage NSW. It’s now on display at Junee, representing the type of carriages that once worked on trains through the main south line.
