**Locomotive 3203, a historic 1890s steam locomotive, has found a new home at the [Cooma Monaro Railway](https://www.facebook.com/coomamonarorailway?__cft__[0]=AZV8ED_6GIDdvuTMCnteeyVrgv7qX0uYbJRFbKr_IKHIWOlaHideTptwUMe20crsX2K5UB7oZ28dgKvslI7a75eR9X1uPeim2wSnwQsQxmwJR6kw-16QtjXFfrdQEh9dxFfhHdw5gicDCm8rvBuYwwNQNdvpf97_0UIAXRO1ZxWTC0e_yO-srIUdRTNZEZWdRmo&__tn__=-).**

The 32 class were once a mainstay of the region, serving the Bombala line throughout the steam era.

Today, 3203 forms part of the State collection and has been lovingly restored by THNSW volunteers to display condition.

The locomotiveâ€™s move forms part of a variety of projects funded by the NSW Government to bring transport heritage to life at the historic railway precinct in Cooma.
