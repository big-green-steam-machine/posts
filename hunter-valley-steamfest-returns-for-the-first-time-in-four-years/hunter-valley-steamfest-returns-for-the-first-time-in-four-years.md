**The Hunter Valley Steamfest returned for the first time in four years on 29 and 30 April.**

Locomotives 3801 and 6029 joined the festivities in the Hunter Valley, operating services between Maitland and Paterson, Branxton and Newcastle Interchange.

The weekend also saw four incredible locomotives barreling down the Hunter Line in the only race of its kind at the Great Quad Train Race. The last time the race ran was in 2016, where our locomotive 3642 went up against 6029, 3016 and 5917.

Well done to all of those involved in the production of this incredible race, including Maitland City Council, ARTC, and the Picnic Train- and of course the crews of 6029 and race winner 3801.

A big thank you to all our volunteers and staff for their hard work and dedication in making this event a huge success.

THNSW looks forward to next year's Steamfest, which returns in April 2024.
