**The outbreak of the First World War had a dramatic impact on Australia, with large numbers of men rushing to enlist to serve their country. At the time, the NSW Railways and Tramways Department was the largest enterprise in the state, employing over 45,000 people.**

Over the course of the war, 8,447 men from the department enlisted, some of whom are pictured in this NSW Railway Unit image taken in April 1917.

By the end of the war, 1,214 men had died in service.

This ANZAC Day, we remember all who have served and died for our country.
