**Locomotive 2705 made its highly anticipated return to steam service at the NSW Rail Museum on March 15 during the biannual** ***Day Out With Thomas*****event — its first public appearance since 2022.**

**The locomotive completed its final trial runs the day before, following extensive boiler reconditioning carried out by the museum’s workshop team in Thirlmere. Now sporting a vibrant red livery, 2705 took centre stage during the event, portraying James from the beloved children’s series.**

More than 12,000 visitors attended over six days, enjoying an opportunity to see the newly restored engine. This year’s *Day Out With Thomas* was refreshed with the addition of new and refreshed characters, developed by the museum’s fleet team in close collaboration with Mattel.

The refresh included a brand-new face for Thomas and Toby the railmotor, aligning them to the current *All Engines Go!* series. New characters featured at the event also included Percy, Emily and Hiro.

*Day Out With Thomas* remains one of the museum’s largest events, drawing about 25% of its annual visitors and sparking interest in rail heritage among a new generation of enthusiasts.

Locomotive 2705 will continue to operate during special events. It is next set to appear during the Annual *Thirlmere Festival of Steam* on 17-18 May, where it will be available for cab visits.

Congratulations to the Transport Heritage NSW fleet team for their dedication in returning 2705 to operation. A detailed look at the locomotive’s restoration will be featured in the Autumn 2025 edition of *Roundhouse*.
