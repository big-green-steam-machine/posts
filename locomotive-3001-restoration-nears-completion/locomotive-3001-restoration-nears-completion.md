**119-year-old steam locomotive 3001 has been brought back to life for the first time since the 1990s!**

The locomotive is nearing the end of an extensive three-year restoration by Transport Heritage NSW volunteers and staff based at the NSW Rail Museum.

The team are now working towards having the locomotive ready for its first passenger service as part of next year's Thirlmere Festival of Steam.

3001 was built in 1903 by Beyer, Peacock and Company and originally entered service with the NSW Government Railways (NSWGR) to haul passengers trains on Sydney's expanding suburban rail network.
