**After three years of restoration, 3001 returns to heritage service for the first time in over 25 years. It will join the Transport Heritage NSW fleet based in Thirlmere to provide rides along the Loop Line.**

A huge congratulations to our volunteers and staff behind the restoration of 3001, and a big thank you to our donors for their support. It is a massive achievement to see this locomotive brought back to life for the benefit of current and future generations to come.

3001 will also operate at the Thirlmere Festival of Steam in March 2023, where it will provide heritage services between Thirlmere and Picton or Buxton.
