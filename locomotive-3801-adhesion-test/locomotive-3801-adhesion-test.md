**Locomotive 3801 has undertaken its biggest test yet!**

The ‘adhesion test’ saw 3801 haul 318-tonnes in simulated wet weather conditions along steep 1-in-40 grades, between Hawkesbury River and Cowan in Sydney’s north.

This is a condition for all new locomotives being registered for use on the Sydney Trains network and given 3801 has received an extensive overhaul, it was required to undergo this rigorous testing.

As you’ll see, the engine passed with flying colours!
