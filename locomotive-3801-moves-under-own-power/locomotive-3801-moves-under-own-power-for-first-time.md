**Locomotive 3801 moved under its own power for the first time in over a decade at Chullora today.**

Congratulations to our team of staff and volunteers for reaching this crucial milestone.

3801 will now go through a series of acceptance tests in the coming weeks and months to prepare for its return to service this year.
