**Following recommendations announced by the Government regarding non-essential public gatherings, Transport Heritage NSW has made the difficult decision to postpone the relaunch of locomotive 3801.**

All sales for the relaunch weekend of 28-29 March, as well as shuttles with 3801 at the NSW Rail Museum on 11-13 April have been suspended with all tickets to be refunded in the next 3-5 business days.

This is a great disappointment for all of us, however the safety of everyone is always our highest priority.

We will continue to re-assess the situation with the view to announcing a new relaunch date as soon as reasonably possible.
