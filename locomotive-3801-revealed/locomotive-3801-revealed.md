**On Saturday 28 March, we had the pleasure of steaming locomotive 3801 for the first time since receiving its shiny new coat of paint.**

During this period of social distancing and in place of last weekendâ€™s planned relaunch, we put together this short video as a small way of recognising the thousands of volunteer and staff hours put into the project.

You can also now view images and more footage of the locomotive in its shiny green livery at the [3801 project page](http://www.thnsw.com.au/3801).

We look forward to inspiring a new generation of rail fans across NSW with 3801 in the not too distant future!
