**Locomotive 3820 has been approved for reconstruction funding by the Independent Funding & Advisory Panel (IFAP).**

The project will focus first on the professional removal of hazardous materials (asbestos) from the historic locomotive, enabling the reconstruction of the locomotive for display at the NSW Rail Museum.

The project scope includes:

* Disassembling the boiler and cylinder cladding.
* Removal of the asbestos from both the locomotive and its tender by expert licenced contractors.
* Cleaning components, treating corrosion, and reconstructing the locomotive.
* Repairing the driver’s cab timbers based on detailed inspection.
* Repainting the locomotive and tender in ‘out of service’ livery.
* Returning the reconstructed display-ready locomotive to the NSW Rail Museum.

The reconstruction work will be carried out by THNSW volunteers and staff at Chullora, where the current project to restore Locomotive 5711’s tender is nearing completion. 5711’s tender will now be stored pending further plans and funding for the locomotive’s reconstruction.

**About 3820**

Built in 1947 by the NSW Government Railways’ Eveleigh Workshops, 3820 was the 20th of 30 38-class locomotives designed for express trains. While the first five were streamlined, the subsequent 25, including 3820, were not streamlined and were built at the Eveleigh and Cardiff Workshops.

3820 has a notable history in steam operations:

* May 1964: Hauled the last steam-operated Riverina Express and the final revenue steam duty on the Main South line beyond Goulburn.
* December 1968: Was the last C38 class to be overhauled while in service.
* December 1970: Worked the final steam-hauled express passenger train in Australia, the Newcastle Flyer, and was the last 38-class in revenue service.

After its withdrawal, 3820 was preserved by the NSW Rail Transport Museum (now Transport Heritage NSW), initially at Enfield and later relocated to Thirlmere in 1975. In 1980, it was displayed at Central Station for the 125th anniversary of NSW rail operations.

3820 is the only 38-class locomotive preserved in its original condition and remains part of the NSW Government-owned state collection managed by Transport Heritage NSW.
