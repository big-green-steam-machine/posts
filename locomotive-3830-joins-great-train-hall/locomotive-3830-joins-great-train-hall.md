**Transport Heritage NSW has worked with the Powerhouse Museum to bring locomotive 3830 from their collection to display in the Great Train Hall at the NSW Rail Museum.**

3830 was the last of the 38 class, entering service in 1949. Over the 18 years of its service life, it travelled more than 1.7 million kilometres, and hauled the inaugural spirit of progress from Albury to Sydney.

The team at the Powerhouse Museum have worked diligently with us to prepare 3830 for display. The locomotive is now on display at the NSW Rail Museum.
