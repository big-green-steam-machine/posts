**The Locomotive 5711 project team are developing a plan to restore, preserve and display the locomotive.**

With progress being made on 5711â€™s tender at Chullora, a group of volunteers supported by key THNSW staff, attended Valley Heights Locomotive Depot earlier this month to develop the scope of works and method to move the engine out from the precinct.

Over the next month, this scope will be finalised to allow a funding application to be submitted for completion of the project.

Well done to the team!
