**To help ensure safety for both rail traffic and road users, traffic surveys near level crossings in **Balmoral**, **Buxton**, **Couridjah**, **Hill Top** and **Thirlmere** will occur throughout the remainder of May and into the month of June.**

The results of these surveys will help Transport Heritage NSW and Wingecarribee Shire Council finalise level crossing designs for the Loop Line Upgrade Project. The vehicle-count data is also being used to understand the possibility of gaining separate funding to improve the existing operational level crossings in the Wollondilly Shire Council area.

**The traffic survey trailers use cameras to count vehicle traffic numbers only, and despite their similar appearance, are not enforcement trailers.**

Additionally, Transport Heritage NSW are now finalising designs for each station precinct, including Colo Vale, Hill Top, Buxton and Thirlmere. Community information sessions for each of the station precincts will be announced soon.
