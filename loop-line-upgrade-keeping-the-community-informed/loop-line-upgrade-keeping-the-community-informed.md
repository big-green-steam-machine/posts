**Transport Heritage NSW has introduced a new regular newsletter for residents of towns located alongside the NSW Rail Museum's Loop Line.**

The newsletter aims to keep the community informed on progress associated with the [Loop Line upgrade project](http://www.thnsw.com.au/loop-line), announced earlier this year.

Residents who live in Picton, Thirlmere, Couridjah, Buxton, Balmoral, Hill Top and Colo Vale will soon receive the first newsletter in the mail, while a new Facebook page has also been established online.

Additional engagement will be undertaken with the community in 2022, as station precinct and other designs are developed.
