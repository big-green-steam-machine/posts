**Following a brief pause to finalise supplier arrangements for remaining work packages, we’re pleased to confirm construction to complete the Loop Line Upgrade Project will recommence within the next two months.**

**This will kick off the final construction phase of the project and will bring us one step closer to delivering an upgraded heritage rail experience for the region.**

**What we have undertaken to date**

Significant progress was made in 2024, including replacing over 18,000 sleepers across the 18.7km section of track between Buxton and Colo Vale, installation of new infrastructure at Colo Vale to permit locomotives to run-around for the return journey, replacement of the Ligar Street Underbridge, initial hazardous tree removals, and initial upgrades to five level crossings along the line.

**Remaining works to be completed**

The following works will be undertaken to complete the Loop Line Upgrade Project, between now and early 2026:

**PLATFORM SECURED FOR HILL TOP**

Following strong advocacy from residents of Hill Top and continued discussions with the NSW Government, the existing station platform at Hill Top village will be secured and reactivated in time for the line’s reopening.

This reactivated platform will ensure safe access for passengers to alight and board heritage trains, operating between the NSW Rail Museum at Thirlmere and Colo Vale.

The platform reactivation will complement the newly installed play equipment and play area, which were funded through grants secured by the Hill Top Community Association and Wingecarribee Shire Council, with support from Transport Heritage NSW and the NSW Government.
