**Works are now well underway on the Loop Line Upgrade Project between Buxton and Colo Vale.**

**The team are currently focused on re-sleepering the 18.3-kilometre section of track, with more than 15,000 sleepers being replaced.**

Already, re-sleepering of a six-kilometre stretch between Colo Vale and Hill Top is complete and will now continue over the coming weeks through Balmoral and onto Buxton.

Looking ahead, planned construction works include:

* The replacement of the Ligar Street Bridge (Hill Top) with a newly fabricated span.
* Remediation of a small number of failed culverts.
* The installation of a turnout at Colo Vale.
* Geotechnical stabilisation of cuttings.
* The placement of more than 7,000 tonnes of new ballast right along the reactivated section of line.
