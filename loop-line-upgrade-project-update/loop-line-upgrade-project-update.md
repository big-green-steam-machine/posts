**To ensure the Loop Line Upgrade Project meets the highest of environmental standards, Transport Heritage NSW is currently undertaking a detailed review of environmental factors as required by Transport for NSW.**

What does this mean?

* The Review of Environmental Factors (REF) is currently mid-way and involves a detailed assessment of project scope impacts on biodiversity, noise and vibration, waterways, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples heritage, Non-Aboriginal heritage and contamination in order to protect our environment.
* Construction on the line’s extension between Buxton and Colo Vale will commence after completion and approval of the REF, estimated to be April 2023.

As a result of this additional assessment work, the Loop Line Upgrade Project is now expected to be completed in 2024.

In the meantime, work continues on:

* Design – including station precincts, level crossings and track
* Track turnout construction and delivery
* Building capacity for future operations – the restoration and return to service of steam locomotive 3001 and railcar 623/723
* Regular meetings with local community groups
