**Channel 7's coverage of the 2025 Thirlmere Festival of Steam**

**More than 8,200 visitors joined Transport Heritage NSW and Wollondilly Shire Council at the NSW Rail Museum for one of our biggest and best Thirlmere Festival of Steam yet—an increase on last year and a testament to the incredible work of our team and volunteers.**

The festival marked THNSW's most complex Loop Line steam train timetable to date, with 27 train departures, 9 locomotives, and 100% on-time performance—thanks to our dedicated crew and operations team, and our volunteers who worked across the weekend to bring the magic of steam to Thirlmere.

In addition, this year's festival saw the NSW Rail Museum remain open until 8pm on Saturday 17 May. Visitors had the opportunity to explore and see a range of attractions, including heritage demonstrations, steam train rides, carnival rides, live entertainment, fire dancers and fireworks.

The continued growth of the Thirlmere Festival of Steam is a testament to the strong partnership between Transport Heritage NSW and Wollondilly Shire Council—an initiative that began as part of Council’s 2019 Destination Management Plan and was brought to life following COVID in 2022. What started as a strategic goal has since evolved into one of the region’s most iconic and successful events, drawing thousands of visitors and delivering value to the local community.

A huge thank you to all our teams who made the weekend a success. Your passion, teamwork, and commitment continue to make this event truly special.

*The Thirlmere Festival of Steam is set to return in May 2026.*
