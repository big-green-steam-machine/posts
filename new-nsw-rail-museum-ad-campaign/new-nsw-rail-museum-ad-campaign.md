**A new ad campaign has been developed to promote the NSW Rail Museum, ahead of the April school holidays.**

Thanks to the support of Destination NSW, the ads will see the NSW Rail Museum promoted on TV in the Sydney metro market for the very first time.

The campaign creative reflects regular visitor feedback; that a day out at the NSW Rail Museum is a surprising and joyful experience, especially the authenticity of the steam train experiences and extensive collection.

The campaign will run from 3â€”17 April.
