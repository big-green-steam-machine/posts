**The NSW Government has announced an additional $9.1 million to complete the Loop Line Upgrade Project.**

The funding is in addition to the $5.5 million committed by the NSW Government in 2019 and allows Transport Heritage NSW to now complete all works associated with the line's upgrade.

Work will commence from this week on the existing operational section to Buxton, before moving onto reactivating the line to Colo Vale from early next year.

The project is expected to be completed by mid-2023.
