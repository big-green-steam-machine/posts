**Transport Heritage NSW and the NSW Rail Museum are pleased to announce the first stage of funding has now been received as part of the NSW Governmentâ€™s commitment of $5.5 million to upgrade the loop line.**

This will enable works to be undertaken on motorising the points at Picton to allow safer and easier access from the loop line to the main line, meaning more efficient access for our heritage trains to the broader NSW rail network.

It will also allow for a more detailed engineering assessment and scope of works to be developed for upgrading the line, particularly the section from Buxton to Colo Vale.

Further updates will be provided as work progresses.
