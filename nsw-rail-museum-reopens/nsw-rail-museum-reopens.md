**The NSW Rail Museum held a special members and annual pass holders day on Saturday 4 July, ahead of its reopening to the public on Sunday 5 July.**

The Museum had been closed for an extended period due to COVID-19 and is now open every weekend for pre-booked visits.

For a limited time, visitors can get up close to recently restored steam [locomotive 3801](http://www.thnsw.com.au/3801) â€” fresh from an over decade long restoration.

##### To keep everyone safe, tickets must be pre-booked as the Museum is strictly limiting the number of people on-site at any one time.

For further information and to book, visit the [NSW Rail Museum website.](http://www.nswrailmuseum.com.au/weekends)
