**More than $175,000 will be awarded to twelve heritage transport groups across NSW as part of this year’s Transport Heritage Grants Program.**

The NSW Government funded program supports the restoration and conservation of the state’s heritage transport assets and encourages the community to rediscover the culture, events and people that helped shape transport in NSW over the past 165 years.

Transport Heritage NSW CEO, Andrew Moritz, said this year’s grants reflect the wide range of collections and interests of those in the heritage transport sector.

> “The Transport Heritage Grants Program provides much needed support to the many volunteers who work tirelessly across our State to bring our rich transport history to life,” Mr. Moritz said.

“Whether it be replacing upholstery in a vintage bus, repainting a locomotive or developing museum displays and interpretation, this program is vital to heritage transport groups across the state.”

The program administered by the Royal Australian Historical Society (RAHS) and supported by Transport Heritage NSW, received over $488k in applications from some 19 heritage transport groups across NSW.
