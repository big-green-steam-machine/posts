**Transport Heritage NSW will undertake track renewal works on the Loop Line at Thirlmere and Buxton between 29 January 28 February..**

**The maintenance works will replace track that has come to an end of its useful life including turnout infrastructure which allows trains to move from one track to another.**

Consequently, the Loop Line will be closed for this period, and heritage trains from the NSW Rail Museum will not operate.

Works will occur from 7am to 6pm Mondays to Fridays and 8am to 1pm on Saturdays. All residents and businesses in the vicinity of these works will be notified to ensure that they are informed of the project. Materials and machinery for the works will start arriving on site from 8 January 2024.

To ensure both vehicle and pedestrian safety, traffic management will be at the Oaks Street level crossing in Thirlmere. Please allow extra time if you are travelling through the area.

Due to the nature of the works planned for Buxton, the level crossing will be closed for up to 12 hours from 6am to 6pm on Tuesday 13 February 2024 subject to the weather.

Residents and businesses are advised to plan alternative routes on 13 February. A detour will be in place, with Traffic control staff on site to escort pedestrians safely across.
