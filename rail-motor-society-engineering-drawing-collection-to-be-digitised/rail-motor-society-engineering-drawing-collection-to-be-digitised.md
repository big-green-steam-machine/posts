**Our NSW transport heritage tells the story of our state's growth and development. Transport Heritage Grants supply funding to organisations and individual to maintain and share transport heritage assets and stories with the general public.**

The Rail Motor Society's aging, hardcopy engineering drawings, will be digitised thanks to a 2021 Transport Heritage Grant.

Robert Spencer, Volunteer Rail Engineer, shares more about the collection that will be digitised in this video.
