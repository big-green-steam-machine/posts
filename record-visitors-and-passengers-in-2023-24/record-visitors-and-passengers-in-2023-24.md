**Transport Heritage NSW (THNSW) has once again achieved record engagement, with 101,000 passengers onboard its heritage trains and more than 87,000 visitors to its two museums during the 2023-24 financial year.**

This marks the first time the organisation has carried over 100,000 passengers on its heritage trains within a single financial year, reflecting a more than 10% increase on the previous year.

The NSW Rail Museum had its biggest year on record with more than 82,000 visitors and has now become one of the most visited railway museums in the country. Significant investment continues to be made at the NSW Rail Museum in expanding capacity and heritage train experiences with the Loop Line Upgrade Project.

The Blue Mountains based Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum also achieved a record, with almost 5,000 visitors during the financial year.

Online, Transport Heritage NSW now enjoys a following comparable to some of Australia's leading cultural institutions, boasting a combined audience of over 137,000 and content that reached over 24 million people in 2023-24.

These record results are attributed to a continued strategic focus on enhancing capacity and raising awareness of THNSW’s museums and experiences.

Congratulations to all of the THNSW volunteers and staff team for achieving such remarkable results.
