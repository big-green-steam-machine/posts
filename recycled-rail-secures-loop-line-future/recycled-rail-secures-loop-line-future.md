**Over the past week, the NSW Rail Museum has received several deliveries of second-hand rail in 10,000 metre quantities.**

The 110m length rails have been recycled from the Junee - Griffith branch line and will be used to upgrade existing sections of the line between Picton and Buxton, as well as on the future extension to Colo Vale.

This will ensure heritage trains can operate on the line, both safely and efficiently, for generations to come.
