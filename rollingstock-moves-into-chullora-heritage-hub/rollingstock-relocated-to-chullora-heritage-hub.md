**The refurbishment of the Tank Annex Building at the new Chullora Heritage Hub is complete, and heritage rollingstock from the State Collection has now taken up residence.**

Transport Heritage NSW is proud to have brought this amazing heritage building to life and grateful for the support of its partners, Transport for NSW, the Transport Asset Holding Entity of NSW (TAHE)Â and contractor Arenco.

THNSW was also delighted to host 9 News for a first-hand look at the new state-of-the-art facility. You can view the report on the [9 News YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOY6WimGNIg).

Transport Heritage NSW members will have an opportunity to tour the new facility in the near future. If you're interested in becoming a member, visit [www.thnsw.com.au/membership](http://www.thnsw.com.au/membership).
