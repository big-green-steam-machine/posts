**THNSW has commenced relocating various items of historic rollingstock to the new Heritage Hub at Chullora from this week.**

**The move follows the completion of the Tank Annex Building refurbishment and its handover this month to THNSW.**

Rollingstock along with associated parts and spares, and other smaller collection items, are now being relocated from Broadmeadow, Eveleigh and Thirlmere, and will continue through until late February.

Tender Tab 381 (pictured above) was the first of over 50 items to be relocated. This tender once operated across various parts of the state as part of the 17-class steam locomotive fleet in the 1800s and well into the 20th century.

Further details and updates will be provided on THNSWâ€™s news page and social media channels as relocation works now ramp up.

*THNSW members can look forward to an exclusive opportunity to tour this new long-term storage and preservation facility later this year. Not a member? Find out more at the* [*THNSW membership page*](http://www.thnsw.com.au/membership)*.*
