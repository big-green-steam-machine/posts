**Transport Heritage NSW welcomed 35 representatives from 17 sector groups across New South Wales to its biannual** ***Sector Development Day*****, held at History House, Sydney on Saturday 5 April.**

**The event provided a valuable platform for sector groups to share key insights, discuss current initiatives, and learn from one another. A wide range of topics were covered, including updates on various projects funded through Stream 1, 2, and 3 grants currently underway across the state.**

Lachlan Valley Railway presented on their Stream 2 funded restoration of AB91, while Canberra Rail Museum shared progress on the restoration of AL1040, which is partially funded through the Transport Heritage Grants Program (THGP). Oberon Tarana Heritage Railway offered practical insights into records management and reporting using Microsoft Access. The Sydney Bus Museum and Sydney Tramway Museum also spoke about their collaborative efforts across museum and operational activities.

From THNSW, life member and longtime volunteer David Oram presented the 5711 Tender Project as a case study in best practice for heritage restoration. THNSW Managers John Thorogood and Leah Domanski also delivered a presentation on managing hazardous materials in transport heritage collections.

Additionally, THNSW shared results from its inaugural *Transport Heritage Sector Survey*. The survey gathered key data on volunteer and membership numbers, visitor and passenger figures, operating hours, and events across the sector. These findings will help THNSW tailor its support services to volunteer groups and strengthen advocacy efforts with government and the broader transport sector.

A sincere thank you to all representatives who travelled from across New South Wales to attend the Sector Development Day and contribute to the ongoing growth and sustainability of our stateâ€™s transport heritage sector.
