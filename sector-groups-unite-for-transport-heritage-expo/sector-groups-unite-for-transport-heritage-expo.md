**The 2019 Transport Heritage Expo was a huge success, as more than 10,400 passengers enjoyed three modes of heritage transport right in the heart of Sydney.**

From 8 – 10 June, Sydneysiders were treated to historic train, bus and boat rides from Central Station and Darling Harbour. Shuttle rides were provided by a range of sector groups, including:

* Historic Electric Traction
* Lachlan Valley Railway
* NSW Rail Museum
* Rail Motor Society
* Sydney Bus Museum
* Sydney Heritage Fleet
* Sydney Tramway Museum

Other event partners included Sydney Trains, NSW TrainLink and the Australian National Maritime Museum.

This record-breaking event was an excellent example of local sector groups coming together to connect the community with our state’s rich transport history.

Congratulations to everyone involved and thank you for your contributions.
