**Transport Heritage NSW (THNSW) would like to respond to today’s media reports surrounding the relocation of Locomotive No. 1 from the Powerhouse Museum to the NSW Rail Museum at Thirlmere.**

THNSW has been in discussions with the Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences (MAAS) about the potential temporary relocation of Locomotive No. 1 to the NSW Rail Museum at Thirlmere for public display.

While discussions are continuing, no decision has been reached or made.

THNSW has enjoyed a long-standing working relationship with both the NSW Government and MAAS. THNSW not only cares for the NSW Government’s broader transport heritage collection, but also several MAAS collection items, including the ornate Governor General’s carriage and two of MAAS’s operational steam locomotives.

Locomotive No. 1 is a much-loved iconic object which heralded the beginning of the NSW railways. THNSW welcomes the opportunity to display Locomotive No. 1 on a temporary basis, should a decision be made to place it on loan to the NSW Rail Museum.

The NSW Rail Museum is home to the largest display collection and operating rail heritage in NSW, including recently restored iconic steam locomotive 3801.
