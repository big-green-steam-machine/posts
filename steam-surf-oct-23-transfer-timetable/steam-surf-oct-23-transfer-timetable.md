**Transport Heritage NSW is set for locomotive 3801 to make its first passenger service to Wollongong since its restoration with *Steam to the Surf* running from Central station on 14 and 15 October.**

Below is the timetable for locomotive 3801's transfer to Eveleigh ahead of the event. Times are indicative only, and may run earlier or later depending on the wider rail network. Those who intend to catch a glimpse of the train, please remember to stand behind the yellow line at stations, and remain only in publicly accessible areas, clear of the rail corridor.
