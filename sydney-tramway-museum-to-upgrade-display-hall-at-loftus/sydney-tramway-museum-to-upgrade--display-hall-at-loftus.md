**Transport Heritage Grants support the restoration and conservation of the stateâ€™s heritage transport assets. They also fund projects that encourage the community to rediscover the culture, events and people that shaped transport in NSW over the past 165 years.**

In the 2021 funding round, Sydney Tramway Museum will receive funding to update its display hall at Loftus.

Hear more about the project in this video featuring Sydney Tramway Museum volunteer, Laura Huang.
