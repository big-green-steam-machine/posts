**The wait is over!**

**Following a decade long restoration, Transport Heritage NSW is pleased to announce the return of locomotive 3801.**

3801 will operate several steam train rides during a special launch weekend at Central Station on Saturday 13 and Sunday 14 March 2021.

The relaunch marks a new era for 3801 as it returns to the tracks for the first time since 2007 and inspires a new generation of railfans.

Following the launch weekend, 3801 will visit a variety of towns and regions across NSW, including the Southern Highlands in March, Albury, Wagga Wagga, Junee in April and Blue Mountains in May. The engine will also visit western NSW and northern NSW later in the year.

Further details will be made available as they're confirmed on the [3801 relaunch page.](http://www.thnsw.com.au/3801)
