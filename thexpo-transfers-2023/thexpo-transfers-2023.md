Following the transfer of the Pullman sets to Sydney earlier today, Transport Heritage NSW is set for its steam locomotives to make their way to Central Station for Transport Heritage Expo ahead of this weekend.

Below are the timetables for the two transfers across Thursday 28 and Friday 29 September. Times are indicative only, and may run earlier or later depending on the wider rail network.

Those who intend to catch a glimpse of the train, please remember to stand behind the yellow line at stations, and remain only in publicly accessible areas, clear of the rail corridor.
