The Transport Heritage Grants Program is a NSW Government funded program administered by the Royal Australian Historical Society (RAHS) and THNSW. The program supports the restoration and conservation of the state’s heritage transport assets, and encourages the community to rediscover the culture, events and people that helped shape transport in NSW over the past 165 years. 

Updates on the funded projects will be made on the THNSW social media pages.
