**The much-loved Thirlmere Festival of Steam will return in 2021 following a transition agreement reached between the Rotary Club of Picton, Wollondilly Shire Council and Transport Heritage NSW.**

This year’s Thirlmere Festival of Steam had been postponed due to bushfires impacting the region.

“While we had been in discussions with our event partners about a new date for 2020, the Coronavirus situation has further complicated our planning efforts,” said Thirlmere Festival of Steam Committee Chair, Geoff Cannon.

“This is disappointing for us Rotarians as 2020 was to be our last Festival, however on the upside we are equally pleased to have now secured the Festival’s future for 2021 and beyond.”

From 2021, the Thirlmere Festival of Steam will be officially managed by Wollondilly Shire Council and Transport Heritage NSW.

“On behalf of the community, I would like to thank all Rotarians involved in the Festival for their stewardship of this annual event over many years,” said Wollondilly Shire Council Executive Director, Community and Corporate, Ally Dench.

“With our community dealing with the aftermath of bushfires, floods and now the impacts of the Coronavirus, events such as the Thirlmere Festival of Steam will be front and centre for Council in 2021.”

Transport Heritage NSW, operators of the NSW Rail Museum, have also reaffirmed their commitment to the annual event.

> “We look forward to working with Wollondilly Shire Council in further developing and expanding this annual celebration of steam and nostalgia which has continued to attract thousands to the area for over 30 years,” said Transport Heritage NSW CEO, Andrew Moritz.

As the Coronavirus situation evolves, we will continue to monitor advice from the relevant government authorities in relation to events and gatherings.

Further information on event arrangements for 2021, including stallholder and sponsorship opportunities, will be announced later this year.
