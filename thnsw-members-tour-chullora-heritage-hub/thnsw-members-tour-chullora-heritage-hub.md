**THNSW members and representatives of some sixteen transport heritage groups were among the first to tour the newly opened Chullora Heritage Hub on Saturday 4 May.**

The tour provided an opportunity to see the more than 40 items of historic rollingstock which had recently been relocated to the new facility and a rare insight into heritage rollingstock conservation.

Earlier in the day, a sector development workshop was held with presentations from three groups on recent projects.

Tracy Grover spoke about the Sea Heritage Foundation’s National Significance Assessment project of the MS Cape Don, Craig Moore presented on the first 12 months of Cooma Monaro Railway’s Museum being open to the public, and THNSW Valley Heights’ volunteers Sue Fulton and Ted Dickson showcased the progress made on the adaptive reuse of EHO 668. THNSW volunteer Ben Armstrong also provided an overview of the Engineering Standards now available to sector groups.

*Our special thanks to the Sydney Bus Museum, who provided heritage bus connections between Strathfield Station and Chullora.*
