Transport Heritage NSW (THNSW) is proud to announce a new partnership with the National Film & Sound Archive (NFSA) to celebrate over 50 years since the production of the iconic Australian film *A Steam Train Passes.*

The collaboration will feature a special cinema viewing of the film, along with rare archival footage of the beloved 38 class locomotives, showcasing the grandeur of NSW’s rail history.

The event will be held in Sydney and Canberra on a date to be announced for early 2025, offering a nostalgic journey back in time to celebrate the final days of steam transport in New South Wales.

The screening of *A Steam Train Passes* will include a short documentary, including with the film’s producer Anthony Buckley. The evening will be complemented by exclusive NFSA archival footage from the Jim Powe collection, preserving the power and elegance of the legendary 38 class steam engines for future generations to experience.

Transport Heritage NSW Head of Engagement, David Bennett, expressed excitement about the partnership.

“We are thrilled to join forces with the National Film & Sound Archive to bring *A Steam Train Passes* back to the big screen. This film beautifully captures the magic and romance of steam train travel and combined with the NFSA's rich archival footage of 38 class locomotives, it’s a fitting tribute to our state’s transport heritage. This collaboration provides a unique opportunity for rail enthusiasts, historians, and film lovers alike to celebrate a golden era of NSW rail travel.”

NFSA Chief Curator, Meagan Loader, added:

> “This partnership highlights the important role film and sound archives play in preserving our nation’s cultural history. *A Steam Train Passes* is a masterpiece of Australian filmmaking that captures the spirit of a time when steam locomotives were the backbone of transportation.”
