**Transport Heritage NSW (THNSW) is pleased to announce the acquisition of South Bulli Locomotive No.2, an extraordinary piece of industrial heritage with regional, state, and international significance.**

**This small yet remarkable locomotive is a proud representation of the colliery railways that once powered the Illawarra and Hunter Valley during their industrial boom. South Bulli No.2 is not only an Illawarra treasure but also a global rarity, being the oldest surviving locomotive built by Hudswell Clarke & Co., a renowned UK manufacturer of industrial steam engines.**

Currently displayed outside Bulli Station, South Bulli No.2 will soon begin a new chapter as it moves to the Chullora Heritage Hub, where it will be preserved and safeguarded for future generations.

**A rich history of service**

Built in 1888, South Bulli No.2 played a pivotal role in NSW’s industrial growth. It was originally purchased by industrialist Thomas Saywell to serve the South Bulli Colliery, transporting coal from Russell Vale to the Bellambi jetty. Over its working life, the locomotive underwent minor modifications but remained a steadfast contributor to the region’s economy before being retired in 1962.

**A long preservation journey**

After retirement, the locomotive embarked on a journey through several museums and locations. Initially donated to the Australian Railway Historical Society (ARHS) in 1966, it was later displayed at the NSW Rail Transport Museum (now THNSW) and loaned to the Illawarra Light Railway Museum Society. While it received several cosmetic restorations over the years, decades of exposure to the elements have taken a toll, highlighting the urgent need for its conservation.

THNSW was successful in securing the locomotive following its acquisition from the Black Diamond Heritage Centre.

**Looking ahead** The move to Chullora Heritage Hub will provide South Bulli No.2 with the protective environment it deserves, ensuring its unique story continues to inspire railway enthusiasts, historians, and the Illawarra community. THNSW is committed to restoring and preserving this invaluable locomotive as a testament to the legacy of NSW’s industrial and railway history.

*Further updates will be provided as the locomotive is transferred from its present location to the Chullora Heritage Hub.*
