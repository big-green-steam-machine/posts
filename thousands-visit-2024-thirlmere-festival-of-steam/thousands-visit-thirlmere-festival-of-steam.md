**The NSW Rail Museum welcomed over 7,600 people during the 2024 Thirlmere Festival of Steam on 18 and 19 May.**

**Now in its 35th year, the annual Thirlmere Festival of Steam celebrates the steam technology that powered New South Wales for over a century, and those dedicated to keeping its legacy alive today.**

Held in partnership with Wollondilly Shire Council, this year's festival was expanded into the evening for the first time since 2018 with a night train ride that culminated in fireworks. The festival also welcomed a number of major participants, including Eveleigh Blacksmiths, the NSW Police Mounted Unit, Fizzics Education, and the Powerhouse Museum.

In addition, more than 200 eager runners raced steam locomotive 3001 from Buxton and Couridjah stations to Thirlmere in the Huff 'n' Puff road race on 26 May.

Many thanks to our dedicated volunteers and staff who were able to bring this event to life in the weeks leading up and over the weekend.
