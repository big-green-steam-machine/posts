**The Thirlmere Festival of Steam made its long-awaited return on Saturday 25 & Sunday 26 June.**

Following a three-year absence, Wollondilly Shire Council and Transport Heritage NSW (THNSW) partnered to deliver this year’s event, with more locomotives and static engines in steam than ever before.

On Saturday 25 June visitors enjoyed steam train rides at the NSW Rail Museum, as well as a range of amusement rides and activities outside the Museum’s gates organised by Council.

On Sunday 26 June, it was double the fun with market stalls, live performances, a vintage car display, street parade and all the activities at the NSW Rail Museum.

The event certainly did not disappoint, with the entire THNSW operational steam fleet in operation, including locomotives 2705, 3265, 3526, 3642, 3801 and 6029, as well as coal grab 1064.

While most of the locomotives were involved in hauling up to 22 shuttle journeys from Thirlmere to Picton or Buxton and return, locomotive 2705 stood proudly in steam at the Museum’s amphitheatre for cab visits while coal grab 1064 steamed its way up and down Thirlmere yard to the pleasure of spectators.

A record 8,500 people visited the NSW Rail Museum in just two days – beating previous Festival results by the thousands and many more people participated in all the Festival activities outside the Museum.
