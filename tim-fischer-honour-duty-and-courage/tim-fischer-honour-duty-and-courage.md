**Transport Heritage NSW would like to express our condolences to the family and friends of The Hon. Tim Fischer AC, former Nationals leader and deputy Prime Minister of Australia.**

Among the busyness of his varied career, Mr Fischer was an avid rail enthusiast. His passion, enthusiasm and advocacy for heritage railways was widely known and respected here in Australia and around the world.

He hosted the ABC radio program The Great Train Show, wrote several books, including Steam: Locomotives that Galvanised the Nation, and advocated for rail both in and out of parliament.

Mr Fischer will be missed by the community and all those involved in railway preservation.
