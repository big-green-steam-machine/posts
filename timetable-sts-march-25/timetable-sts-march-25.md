**Transport Heritage NSW is set for this weekend's** ***Steam to Surf*****, with locomotive 3526 to transfer from Thirlmere to Eveleigh on Friday and returning Sunday evening.**

Fridayâ€™s transfer will see locomotive 3526 travel directly from Thirlmere to Eveleigh. The locomotive will then haul the first main line steam experience of 2025 from Central to Wollongong and return on Saturday 1 March and Sunday 2 March, before returning to Thirlmere later that evening.

Below is the timetable for the locomotive's transfer to Eveleigh, as well as the operating timetables for *Steam to Surf*. Transfer times are indicative only and may run earlier or later depending on the wider rail network.

Those who intend to catch a glimpse of the trains, please remember to stand behind the yellow line at stations, and remain only in publicly accessible areas, clear of the rail corridor.
