**Transport Heritage NSW is set to** **operate a weekend of steam train rides from Bathurst Station across the June long weekend.**

The weekend will see Beyer-Garratt 6029 taking passengers on 1.5-hour heritage train experiences from Bathurst Station towards Wimbledon and return on Saturday 8 and Sunday 9 June. The locomotive will then lead the *Orange Day Train* from Bathurst to Millthorpe and Orange on the King's Birthday public holiday.

Prior to the weekend, Beyer-Garratt 6029 will haul the *Bathurst Flyer* as a one-way transfer from Campbelltown to Bathurst on Friday 7 June. The train will stop to pick up passengers at Glenfield, Parramatta and Penrith, and allow for customers to alight at Lithgow.

Below are the confirmed times for this weekend’s operations, as well as the transfer times from Thirlmere to Bathurst. Transfer Times are indicative only – the train may run earlier or later depending on the wider rail network.

Those who intend to catch a glimpse of the trains as they make their way through the mountains, please remember to stand behind the yellow line at stations, and remain only in publicly accessible areas, clear of the rail corridor.
