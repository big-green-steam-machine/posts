**Transport Heritage NSW is set to operate its last weekend of main line steam experiences for 2024 on Saturday 9 and Sunday 10 November.**

The weekend will see locomotive 3265 taking passengers on an extended *Steam to the Surf* service from Central Station to Kiama and return on Saturday 9 November. Following, on Sunday 10 November, the locomotive will haul the *NSW Rail Museum Express* from Central Station direct to the NSW Rail Museum in Thirlmere.

Below are the confirmed times for this weekendâ€™s operations. Due to an unforeseen total fire ban, 3265 will now transfer from Thirlmere to Sydney early on Saturday morning, subject to network conditions. This change does not impact customers travelling on *Steam to the Surf* or the *NSW Rail Museum Express*.

Those who intend to catch a glimpse of the train, please remember to stand behind the yellow line at stations, and remain only in publicly accessible areas, clear of the rail corridor.

Please note, locomotive 3265 is not publicly accessible or visible while stabled. Do not enter the rail corridor to view the locomotive.
