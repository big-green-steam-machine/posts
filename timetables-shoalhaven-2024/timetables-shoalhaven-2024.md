**Transport Heritage NSW is set to operate a weekend of steam train rides in the Shoalhaven region from Bomaderry Station across 24 and 25 August 2024.**

The weekend will see locomotive 3265 taking passengers on 50-minute heritage train experiences from Bomaderry Station towards Berry and return on Saturday 24 and Sunday 25 August. Prior to the event, 3265 will transfer to Tempe for the one-way *Kiama Express* on Friday 23 August.

Below are the confirmed times for this weekend’s operations, as well as the transfer times from Thirlmere to Tempe. Transfer times are indicative only – the train may run earlier or later depending on the wider rail network.

Those who intend to catch a glimpse of the train, please remember to stand behind the yellow line at stations, and remain only in publicly accessible areas, clear of the rail corridor.

Please note, locomotive 3265 is not publicly accessible or visible while stabled. Do not enter the rail corridor to view the locomotive.
