**Following the completion and approval of an extensive Review of Environmental Factors (REF), Transport Heritage NSW is now commencing track infrastructure works on the Loop Line between Buxton and Colo Vale.**

**The track infrastructure works will focus on completing all necessary upgrades to enable the safe operation of heritage trains from Buxton to Colo Vale. Plans for upgrading station precincts remain under review, pending further planning and funding approval.**

Works commence Monday 17 June 2024 and are expected to conclude by mid-2025.

The track infrastructure works include the replacement of sleepers, installation of new ballast, and replacement of failed culverts right along the 18.7 kilometres of track. In addition, engineering works will be undertaken to replace the Ligar Street Rail Bridge at Hill Top, and geotechnical works to cuttings along the rail corridor. These works will not impact local traffic but will create noise and dust typical of construction.

Works hours will be limited to standard daytime construction hours (i.e. 7.00am – 6.00pm Monday to Friday and occasionally 8.00am – 1.00pm on Saturdays) and will be carried out various locations between Buxton and Colo Vale, including at Balmoral and Hill Top.

In addition, THNSW will undertake upgrades on five level crossings between Buxton and Hill Top. During these upgrades, detours, road closures and traffic control will be in place. THNSW will notify impacted members of the community prior to closures.

Once complete, heritage trains based at the NSW Rail Museum will operate one to two times per week from Thirlmere to Colo Vale, with additional premium heritage train experiences expected in the future.
