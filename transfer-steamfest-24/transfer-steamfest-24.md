**Transport Heritage NSW is set for this weekend's Hunter Valley Steamfest, with locomotives 3526 and 6029 to transfer from Thirlmere to Maitland on Friday and returning Monday.**

**Tomorrow's transfer will see locomotives 3526 and 6029 travel together from Thirlmere to Flemington. At Flemington, the consist will split, with 3526 to pick up passengers at Concord West and 6029 waiting at Denistone. The two will then run alongside each other in a parallel run. Once the parallel run concludes at Pennant Hills, the two trains will follow in succession on their transfer to Maitland.**

Below is the timetable for locomotives' transfer to and from Maitland. Times are indicative only, and may run earlier or later depending on the wider rail network.

Those who intend to catch a glimpse of the trains, please remember to stand behind the yellow line at stations, and remain only in publicly accessible areas, clear of the rail corridor.
