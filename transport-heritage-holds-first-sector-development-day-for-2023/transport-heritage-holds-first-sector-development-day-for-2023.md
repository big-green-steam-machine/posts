**Representatives from heritage transport organisations across NSW gathered for THNSW's sector development forum at the Sydney Bus Museum in Leichhardt**

The forum provides a unique opportunity for volunteer-managed transport heritage groups to share experiences and knowledge with one another, with representatives from 12 sector groups in attendance.

The day saw presentations from bus, tram, train and maritime conservation groups. In addition, an interactive workshop was conducted with Museums & Galleries NSW, demonstrating how grant assessors make decisions. This helped attendees understand the value of a clear and complete grant application.

THNSW Head of Finance & Corporate Resources, Andy McNeill also presented on Working with Childrenâ€™s Checks and their administration, rules, and limits.

The next Sector Development Day will be held in October.
