**Transport Heritage NSW has recorded its biggest financial year on record.**

**The not-for-profit member-based organisation released its 2022-23 Annual Report this week, reporting a record 91,400 passengers on its heritage train experiences, as well as a record 78,800+ visitors to its flagship NSW Rail Museum.**

In addition, 4,800 visited the volunteer managed Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum in the Blue Mountains and a further 11,500 enjoyed various THNSW programmed heritage transport experiences, operated by sector partners.

The record results are thanks to a strategic focus on building capacity and awareness on THNSW’s more regular museum-based experiences and increasing engagement through key major events, including the annual Thirlmere Festival of Steam, Transport Heritage Expo and several regional based events.

Congratulations to THNSW volunteers and staff on an incredible result.
