**This weekend marks 50 years since the** ***Western Endeavour*** **departed Sydney for its epic journey west to Perth, on 22 August 1970.**

**People in their hundreds and thousands gathered to witness the train as it made its way through cities, towns and rural communities across the country.**

The journey made a legend of locomotive 3801, becoming the first steam locomotive to travel across the Australian continent, assisted by 3813.

To celebrate this historic occasion, THNSW has proudly produced a video featuring stories from our very own members involved in the journey, along with rarely seen archival footage from the ABC.
