**Preliminary works on the Chullora Heritage Hub have now commenced.**

In 2019, the NSW Government together with Transport Heritage NSW, announced that a centralised storage, maintenance and operations facility will be developed at Chullora.

The Chullora Heritage Hub will provide proper storage for the Stateâ€™s transport heritage collection, including rolling stock and small objects, providing much needed protection from deterioration.

Moving to Chullora means Transport Heritage NSW will no longer have collection items at Eveleigh and Broadmeadow, while the NSW Rail Museum at Thirlmere will remain as the public showcase for rail heritage in NSW.
