**Transport Heritage NSW is partnering with the NSW Government to deliver the Chullora Heritage Hub – a new storage facility for the State’s transport heritage assets.**

As the video above shows, works are now advanced on Stage One, focussed on refurbishing the Tank Annex building.

The Tank Annex building will provide secure undercover storage and a centralised location for most of Transport Heritage NSW’s collection of rolling stock.
